Funnily enough (if I may go on a little spiel), I'm actually taking this class as a substitute for a more difficult course that I failed previously. I've actually copleted most of an IT degree at the Missoula College, so I've seen a bunch of classes revolving around the differences between a computer's GUI and the ol' CMD. Professor Valgenti, over there, prefers that students use CMD or Powershell (or Terminal, for Mac people). Unfortunately, he asks for screenshots of absolutely everything, so I'm used to working with a crazy mess of windows open.

Anyway, the big difference between CMD and a GUI is often described as a difference in "ease of use." The avergae person, who is only superficially familiar with computers, will prefer a GUI. GUI's use icons and rather simple selection processes like a mouse or screen-taps to make selections or change settings. Command-line interfaces, however, are all accomplished via text input (and output). The first computers were operated entirely this way. GUI's did not exist when computers first came into being.

Just about the only way they're similar, in fact, is that they're both ways in which a use may input instructions to a computer.
